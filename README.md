These are my attempts to squeeze Bad Apple into a Pico-8 cartridge.

## Prerequisites

- GNU Make (other flavors of `make` might work too)
- [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) - for downloading the Bad Apple source video
- ImageMagick
- Node.js (tested on v22, might work on several older ones)
- `pico8` in `$PATH` (optional; for automatic `.p8.png` generation)
